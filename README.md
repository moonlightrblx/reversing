# reversing
Welcome to my personal collection of reverse engineering projects! This repository contains tools, scripts, and analyses I've developed or extracted while reversing various anticheats and related systems. It's a work in progress, focused primarily on Roblox-related security mechanisms, but may expand to other areas in the future.
